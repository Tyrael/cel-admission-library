# Kubescape Validating Admission Policy library

This is a library of polcies based on [Kubescape controls](https://hub.armosec.io/docs/controls) ready for use with [Kubernetes Validating Admission Policies](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/validating-admission-policy/). In this library Kubescape controls have been re-implemented in [CEL](https://github.com/google/cel-spec/) for your convinience. 

## Using the library

*Note: Kubernetes Validating Admission Policy feature is still it is early phase. 
It has been released as a alphav1 feature in Kubernetes 1.26,
and you need to enable its feature gate to be able to use it. Therefore it is not yet production ready.*


Install latest release of the library:
```bash
# Install configuration CRD
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubescape/cel-admission-library/releases/download/latest/policy-configuration-definition.yaml
# Install basic configuration
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubescape/cel-admission-library/releases/download/latest/basic-control-configuration.yaml
# Install policies
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubescape/cel-admission-library/releases/download/latest/kubescape-validating-admission-policies.yaml
```

You're good to start to use it ðŸ˜Ž

You can apply policies to objects, for example to apply control [C-0016](https://hub.armosec.io/docs/c-0016) (deny `allowPrivilegeEscalation` on containers) on workloads in namespace with label `policy=enforced` just run this:

```bash
# Creating a binding
kubectl apply -f - <<EOT
apiVersion: admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1alpha1
kind: ValidatingAdmissionPolicyBinding
metadata:
  name: c0016-binding
spec:
  policyName: kubescape-c-0016-allow-privilege-escalation
  paramRef:
    name: basic-control-configuration
  matchResources:
    namespaceSelector:
      matchLabels:
        policy: enforced
EOT
# Creating a namespace for running the example
kubectl create namespace policy-example
kubectl label namespace policy=enforced
# The next line should fail
kubectl -n policy-example run nginx --image=nginx --restart=Never
```

## Testing policies

### Cluster
You need a cluster which supports Validating Admission Policies. You can start a simple minikube with the script `scripts/setup-test-minikube-cluster.sh`

### Testing a single policy

You can run the tests associated with a single policy by following these steps.

```bash
cd controls/C-0016
python ../../scripts/run-control-tests.py
```

This script reads the `tests.json` file in the directory, build the policy bindings and test objects and tests the policy with the binding against the test object.

The `tests.json` contains test cases where each case has a
* template object: a yaml in the [test-resources](/test-resources/) directory
* field changes: what changes to be done to the template object before applying it
* expected field: what should be happen when applying the object after field changes
